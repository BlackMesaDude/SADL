**SADL** is a library written in C#.net for **Grand Theft Auto V** a game made by the *Rockstar Games* developers. With this library the developer is able to encrypt or decrypt any supported resource that resides in the game files. 

This library is derived from the *GTA Toolkit* made by [Neodymium146](https://github.com/Neodymium146/) back in 2015 that currently is taking dust. The library was mostly rewritten and optimized.
